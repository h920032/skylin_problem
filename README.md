# skylin_problem by Hugo Shih
## Problem Description
Implement an algorithm that computes the skyline of a list of buildings. The representations of a building and a skyline are as discussed in class except that parentheses are omitted and commas are replaced by spaces. The height and width of a building are always positive integers.

You may assume that there are at most 1000 buildings in each input. The first line of an input is an integer n, indicating the number of buildings. It is followed by n triples of integers, each triple in a separate line, indicating the coordinates of a building.

## Sample input:
8

1 11 5 

2 6 7

3 13 9 

12 7 16 

14 3 25

19 18 22

23 13 29

24 4 28

## Correct output for the sample input:
1 11 3 13 9 0 12 7 16 3 19 18 22 3 23 13 29
